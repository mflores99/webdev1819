    <h1>Baseball</h1>
    <h3>Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams 
    of nine players each who take turns batting and fielding.</h3>
    <div> The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball 
    (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung 
    by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around a series 
    of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored 
    when a player advances around the bases and touches home plate. Players
    on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding 
    team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several 
    ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later 
    attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting,
    such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and 
    fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. </div>

    <h5> One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team,
    constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team
    with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores 
    are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. 
    Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning. 
    Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in 
    England by the mid-18th century.</h5>
